# Automatic Night Light

This is a simple DIY electronics project that automatically turns on an LED in the dark and turns it off when there is sufficient ambient light. It's perfect for beginners learning basic electronics and sensor-based automation.

## Features

- Automatically detects darkness using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- Turns on an LED or light when it's dark
- Energy-efficient and easy to build
- Can be used as a night lamp or hallway light

## Components Used

- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- NPN Transistor (e.g., BC547)
- Resistors
- LED
- Power Supply (e.g., 5V battery or adapter)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Working Principle

The LDR senses the surrounding light level. When light is available, the resistance of the LDR is low, keeping the transistor OFF and the LED OFF. In darkness, the LDR's resistance increases, allowing current to flow through the transistor and turning the LED ON.
